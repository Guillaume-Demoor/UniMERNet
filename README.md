Welcome to UniMERNet's official repository, providing a solution for converting images of mathematical expressions into LaTeX, suitable for diverse real-world scenarios

## News
**2024.4.24** üéâüéâ   Paper available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx).

## TODO

- [ ] Release inference code and checkpoints of UniMERNet.
- [ ] Release UniMER-1M and UniMER-Test.
- [ ] Release the training code of UniMERNet.


## Performance Comparison (BLEU) with SOTA Methods.
> UniMERNet significantly outperforms mainstream models in recognizing real-world mathematical expressions, exhibiting superior performance across Simple Printed Expressions (SPE), Complex Printed Expressions (CPE), Screen-Captured Expressions (SCE), and Handwritten Expressions (HWE), as evidenced by the comparative BLEU Score evaluation.
